This script doesn't work with VS2022. I'm working on a new version.

1. **Open PowerShell as an administrator.**
2. **Run the following command to allow script execution:**
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
    ```
3. **Execute the script:**
    ```powershell
    .\install.ps1
     ```
